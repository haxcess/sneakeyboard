# SneaKeyBoard
A toy. It pretends to be a keyboard and types out phrases between long delays.

Requires a digispark, arduino studio 1.6.5, digistump and FastLED libraries.

Simulates a rogue keyboard. On first powerup, waits between 50-120 minutes then types out a random phrase.
Wait 25-60 minutes and keep doing it.

Some ideas:

Send ctrl-b, ctrl-i, hold down shift, capslock, type out random phrases
